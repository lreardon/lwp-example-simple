# Lurch Web Platform, Simple Example Application

This is one of the smallest possible uses of the
[Lurch Web Platform](https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch).

Read the (heavily commented) code here:

 * [App code](lwp-example-simple.litcoffee) for this specific example
 * [HTML code](index.html) that loads the platform and application

There is also a very simple [build process](gulpfile.litcoffee).
