# Lurch Web Platform, Simple Example Application

This is one of the smallest possible uses of the
[Lurch Web Platform](https://github.com/lurchmath/lurch).

[Visit the live app here.](https://lurchmath.github.io/lwp-example-simple)
It has almost no features beyond ordinary word processing.  Try this:

 * Highlight a section of text and click the `[ ]` button on the toolbar.
 * You should see a group form, and report the number of characters
   inside the group.
 * Groups are visible only when your cursor is inside them.

Read the (heavily commented) code here:

 * [App code](lwp-example-simple.litcoffee) for this specific example
 * [HTML code](index.html) that loads the platform and application

There is also a very simple [build process](gulpfile.litcoffee).
